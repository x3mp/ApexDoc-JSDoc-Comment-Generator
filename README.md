# ApexDoc & JSDoc Comment Generator

A lightweight Visual Studio Code extension to **automatically generate documentation comments** for Apex and JavaScript/TypeScript files (including Lightning Web Components and Aura helpers).

Supports:

-   **ApexDoc** comments for Apex classes, methods, properties, and enum values.
-   **JSDoc** comments for JS/TS classes, functions, methods, properties, and variables.
-   Context-aware generation (detects what you're on and inserts the right snippet).
-   Auto `@param` detection for methods/functions.
-   Proper placement **above annotations** (`@AuraEnabled`, `@api`, etc.).
-   Separate auto-suggest tag lists for ApexDoc and JSDoc.
